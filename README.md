There is 3 versions :\
    - The main.py is an non optimized version but converge\
    - The main_V2.py is quite the same than the previous one but I tried to use numpy which is fastest. This one is not working\
    - The main_V3.py is a new way of thought using numpy and now CONVERGEEEEEE. It's the best one.
